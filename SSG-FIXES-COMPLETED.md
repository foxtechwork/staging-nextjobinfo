## ✅ 3. Calendar Date Fix for SSG

### Problem:
Calendar was using `new Date()` in `useState` which gets fixed during SSG build, causing static dates.

### Solution (LeftSidebar.tsx):
```typescript
const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState<Date | undefined>(undefined);

// Set date on client side to avoid SSG static date issue
useEffect(() => {
  setSelectedDate(new Date());
}, []);
```

**Result**: Calendar now always shows current date, even on static pages.

## ✅ 4. Enhanced Search Function

### Changes Made (useJobs.ts):
Expanded search to include ALL relevant fields:
- Job title (`exam_or_post_name`)
- Recruitment board
- State
- Qualification
- Advertisement number (`advt_no`)
- **All tag fields**:
  - `education_tags`
  - `job_type_tags`
  - `job_area_tags`
  - `experience_level_tags`
  - `post_position_tags`
  - `job_posting_deadline_tags`

**Result**: Users can now search by any keyword including education, job type, location, etc.

## ✅ 5. Enhanced Category Filters - Show ALL Related Jobs

### Problem:
"Popular Categories" and "Quick Links" categories were too restrictive. For example, clicking "Railway" didn't show Metro Rail jobs, RRB jobs, etc.

### Solution (useJobs.ts):
Enhanced category matching to include ALL variations:

#### Railway Jobs Now Include:
- Railway Recruitment Board
- RRB (Railway Recruitment Board)
- Metro Rail
- All railway-related tags in job data

#### Banking Jobs Now Include:
- All banks (SBI, IBPS, RBI, etc.)

- **"Banking Jobs"**: Now uses query parameter `/?category=Bank Jobs` ✅
- **"Railway Jobs"**: Now uses query parameter `/?category=Railway Jobs` ✅
- **"Teaching Jobs"**: Now uses query parameter `/?category=Teaching Jobs` ✅

**Result**: All footer category links work correctly and show proper filtered results.

## ✅ 7. SSG Data Fetching Improvements

- **Removed 200-job limit** for SSG builds
- Now fetches ALL active jobs for:
  - Homepage
  - Category pages
  - State pages
  - Job detail pages (for sidebars)
